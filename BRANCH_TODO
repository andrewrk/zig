Possible kernel bugs:
  - if entries is small (e.g. 1) which means that .ring_entries (a *u32) can be unaligned
  - processes don't exit and can't be killed
    Seems to be unregisterFiles related
  - io_uring_setup returns ENOMEM
  - fence in getCompletion doesn't always work (especially after a write)
