## Building from Source

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/ziglang/zig/_apis/build/status/ziglang.zig?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/ziglang/zig/_build/latest?definitionId=1&branchName=master)

Note that you can
[download a binary of master branch](https://ziglang.org/download/#release-master) or 
[install Zig from a package manager](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/wiki/Install-Zig-from-a-Package-Manager).

### Stage 1: Build Zig from C++ Source Code

#### Dependencies

##### POSIX

 * cmake >= 2.8.5
 * gcc >= 5.0.0 or clang >= 3.6.0
 * LLVM, Clang, LLD development libraries == 10.x, compiled with the same gcc or clang version above
   - Use the system package manager, or [build from source](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/wiki/How-to-build-LLVM,-libclang,-and-liblld-from-source#posix).

##### Windows

 * cmake >= 3.15.3
 * Microsoft Visual Studio. Supported versions:
   - 2015 (version 14)
   - 2017 (version 15.8)
   - 2019 (version 16)
 * LLVM, Clang, LLD development libraries == 10.x
   - Use the [pre-built binaries](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/wiki/Building-Zig-on-Windows) or [build from source](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/wiki/How-to-build-LLVM,-libclang,-and-liblld-from-source#windows).

#### Instructions

##### POSIX

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make install
```

##### MacOS

```
brew install cmake llvm
brew outdated llvm || brew upgrade llvm
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$(brew --prefix llvm)
make install
```

You will now run into this issue:
[homebrew and llvm 10 packages in apt.llvm.org are broken with undefined reference to getPollyPluginInfo](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/4799)
or
[error: unable to create target: 'Unable to find target for this triple (no targets are registered)'](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/5055),
in which case try `-DZIG_WORKAROUND_4799=ON`

Hopefully this will be fixed upstream with LLVM 10.0.1.

##### Windows

## License

The ultimate goal of the Zig project is to serve users. As a first-order
effect, this means users of the compiler, helping programmers to write better
code. Even more important, however, are the end users.

Zig is intended to be used to help end users accomplish their goals. For
example, it would be inappropriate and offensive to use Zig to implement
[dark patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_pattern) and it would be
shameful to utilize Zig to exploit people instead of benefit them.

However, such problems are best solved with social norms, not with software
licenses. Any attempt to complicate the software license of Zig would risk
compromising the value Zig provides to users.

Therefore, Zig is available under the MIT (Expat) License (except where otherwise noted), and comes with a
humble request: use it to make software better serve the needs of end users.
